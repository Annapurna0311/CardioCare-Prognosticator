Heart failure prediction involves using various methods, often leveraging machine learning techniques, to assess the likelihood of an individual developing heart failure. These predictive models typically analyze a combination of risk factors, medical history, and clinical data to provide an estimate of the person's risk. The goal is to identify individuals at higher risk early on, enabling proactive interventions and personalized care plans. Accurate heart failure prediction can contribute to more effective healthcare strategies, improved patient outcomes, and a reduction in healthcare costs associated with heart failure-related complications.
